# Overview

This sample application contains a web api that receives requests from the client application to store or fetch game scores for the authenticated user. This application demonstrates how a single page application authenticates and authorizes with a web api using azure b2c. It is based on the following example [Active-directory-b2c-dotnet-webapp-and-webapi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnet-webapp-and-webapi).
